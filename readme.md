# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset simulating real-world traffic accidents. The dataset includes information such as the date, timing, state, weather conditions, road conditions, number of deaths, and reasons for each accident.

## Contents

* `road_accident.csv`: The CSV file containing traffic accident data.
* `traffic_accident_analysis.py`: The Python script used to perform basic data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Data Analysis

### Summary Statistics

* Displayed basic information about the dataset, including data types and missing values.
* Presented summary statistics for numerical columns to provide insights into the distribution of deaths.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Explored the distribution of accidents across different states, weather conditions, road conditions, timing of the day, and reasons for accidents.
* Identified patterns related to road conditions, weather conditions, and timing of the day.

### Visualization

* Created visualizations to highlight accident hotspots by state and contributing factors for accidents.
* Developed a bar plot to visualize the state-wise total death timing ratio.

## Usefulness

1. **Identifying Accident Hotspots:** The analysis and visualizations help identify states with higher accident frequencies, allowing for targeted intervention and resource allocation in those areas.
2. **Understanding Contributing Factors:** By exploring reasons for accidents, stakeholders can gain insights into the primary contributing factors, aiding in the development of preventive measures and awareness campaigns.
3. **Time-Based Analysis:** The analysis of accidents based on the timing of the day provides valuable information for planning and implementing time-specific safety measures.
4. **Road and Weather Conditions:** Understanding the relationships between accidents, road conditions, and weather conditions is crucial for improving road infrastructure and safety protocols.
